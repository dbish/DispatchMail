[DispatchMail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udvR9OzmmIw) is an open source locally run (though currently using OpenAI for queries) AI-powered email assistant that helps you manage your inbox. It monitors your email, processes it with an AI agent based on your prompts, and provides a (locally run) web interface for managing drafts/responses, and instructions.

## Features

- 🤖 AI-powered email processing through OpenAI
- 📱 Web interface for inbox management
- 🎯 Customizable email filtering and whitelist rules to only give the AI access to specific types of emails
- 📝 Draft generation and email composition
- 🏷️ Automatic Email labeling and organization (including archival)
- 🗄️ Local SQLite database (no cloud dependencies for storage)
- 🕵️‍♂️ Customizable LLM powered deep research on sender profiles

## Planned Roadmap + Current Readiness
This is an early alpha/prototype project, based on the Pete Koomen's article, [AI Horseless Carriages](https://koomen.dev/essays/horseless-carriages/). It's made to run locally for developers who want to tinker. We welcome feedback and plan to improve and expand based on user feedback and interest. We would love to offer a managed, more polished version of this if there is interest as we believe the future of AI Agents working with Humans is collaborative and will require more Human/Agent "multiplayer" spaces.

Long run, we want to not just give AI Agents a place to work in your inbox, but their own AI-native email as well as our colleagues. For now, this is a helpful babystep, and we welcome feedback, contributions, and discussion.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+ (for web interface)
- Gmail account with 2FA enabled
- OpenAI API key (required for AI features)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dbish/DispatchMail.git
   cd DispatchMail
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```

   This will:
   - Install all dependencies
   - Initialize the SQLite database
   - Create a sample configuration file
   - Guide you through account setup

3. Configure your credentials:
   - Edit `web-app/api/credentials.py` with your OpenAI API key
   - For Gmail, create an App Password: https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833 (add a feature request for login with Google if you'd prefer that :) )

4. Start the services:
   ```bash
   # Option A: Use the startup script (recommended)
   python start.py
   
   # Option B: Start manually
   # Terminal 1: Start the web API
   cd web-app
   python api/api.py
   
   # Terminal 2: Start the frontend (in another terminal)
   cd web-app
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser and set up your email account

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually:

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Backend dependencies
cd web-app/api
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend dependencies
cd ../
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Credentials

Create `web-app/api/credentials.py`:
```python
# OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your-openai-api-key'
```

### 3. Initialize Database

```bash
python -c "from database import db; print('Database initialized!')"
```

### 4. Add User Account

You can add user accounts through the web interface or programmatically:
```bash
python -c "
from database import db
db.put_user('your-email@gmail.com', 'imap.gmail.com', 'your-app-password')
print('User added!')
"
```

## Gmail Setup

For Gmail accounts, you need:

1. **Enable 2FA**: Go to your Google Account settings and enable 2-factor authentication
2. **Generate App Password**: 
   - Go to Google Account > Security > App passwords
   - Generate a new app password for "Mail"
   - Use this password when setting up your account in the web interface

## Configuration

### Email Filtering

Configure whitelist rules via the web interface to control which emails are processed:

- **Sender-based rules**: Filter by sender email address
- **Subject-based rules**: Filter by keywords in subject line
- **AI-based rules**: Use natural language to describe filtering criteria

### AI Prompts

Customize the AI behavior by setting:

- **Reading Prompt**: Instructions for how the AI should analyze emails
- **Draft Prompt**: Instructions for how the AI should generate responses

## Database Schema

The SQLite database contains three main tables:

- `emails`: Stores email content and processing status
- `metadata`: Stores configuration, prompts, and user preferences
- `users`: Stores IMAP account credentials

## API Endpoints

The web API provides REST endpoints for:

- `GET /api/emails` - List emails
- `GET /api/emails/<id>` - Get specific email
- `POST /api/emails/<id>/draft` - Update draft
- `GET/POST /api/prompts/reading` - Manage reading prompt
- `GET/POST /api/prompts/draft` - Manage draft prompt
- `GET/POST /api/whitelist` - Manage whitelist rules
- `GET/POST /api/users` - Manage user accounts
- `GET /api/process_emails` - Process unprocessed emails
- `GET /api/get_updates` - Retrieve new emails from server

## Security Notes

- All data is stored locally in SQLite
- Email credentials are stored in the database
- OpenAI API key is stored in `web-app/api/credentials.py`
- Consider using environment variables for production deployments
- The application binds to `0.0.0.0:5000` by default

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failed**: 
   - Make sure you're using an App Password, not your regular password
   - Verify 2FA is enabled on your Google account

2. **Database Errors**:
   - Delete `dmail.db` and restart to reset the database
   - Check file permissions in the project directory

3. **Port Conflicts**:
   - Web API runs on port 5000
   - Frontend runs on port 5173
   - Make sure these ports are available

4. **OpenAI API Errors**:
   - Verify your API key is correct in `web-app/api/credentials.py`
   - Check your OpenAI account has sufficient credits

### Debug Mode

Check logs in the `logs/` directory:
```bash
# View API logs
tail -f logs/api.log

# View frontend logs
tail -f logs/frontend.log
```

## Development

```

### How It Works

1. **Email Retrieval**: The API connects to your Gmail via IMAP to fetch new emails
2. **Filtering**: Emails are filtered based on whitelist rules you configure
3. **AI Processing**: Filtered emails are processed by OpenAI GPT for classification and draft generation
4. **Web Interface**: The React frontend provides a UI for managing emails and drafts
5. **Local Storage**: All data is stored locally in SQLite for privacy

### Adding Features

1. **New AI Prompts**: Modify `web-app/api/agent.py`
2. **New Filters**: Extend `web-app/api/inbox.py`
3. **New API Endpoints**: Add to `web-app/api/api.py`
4. **Frontend Changes**: Modify files in `web-app/src/`
